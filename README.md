This is a [ShiftJS template](https://shiftjs.com/).

Counter is our very basic template. It displays a single number on screen
and lets users increase that by hitting the "+1" button. Data is stored
in a cloud backend, so the counter value persists even when the page is
reloaded.

This template is implemented using React class components. A template based
on React Hooks is also available.
